* Installation
** From melpa
    Use ~M-x package-install RET ivy-yasnippet RET~ to install this package from MELPA.
** Manual
   Install dash, ivy and yasnippet, then put path to file
   ~ivy-yasnippet.el~ somewhere in your ~load-path~.
* Usage
  To use it, call ~ivy-yasnippet~ in ~yas-minor-mode~.

* Options							 :noexport_1:
** ~ivy-yasnippet-expand-keys~
   Value that says how to expand keys before point.
   - If it's nil, never expand keys.
   - If it's the symbol ~always~, always try to expand keys.
   - If it's the symbol ~smart~, expand when a matching candidate is
     selected for the first time.  Once a candidate whose key doesn't
     match whatever is before point is selected, behave like nil until
     the minibuffer exits.

   Default value is ~smart~.

** ~ivy-yasnippet-create-snippet-if-not-matched~
   If non-nil, allow exiting the minibuffer without exact match.
   Doing so will pop up a new buffer for writing a snippet.

** ~ivy-yasnippet-new-snippet~
   Snippet to expand when creating new snippet.
   During expansion, ~name~ is bound to whatever was returned by ~ivy-read~.

** ~ivy-yasnippet-key~
   Face used for keys.

** ~ivy-yasnippet-key-matching~
   Face used for keys that match whatever is before point.
